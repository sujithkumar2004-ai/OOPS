        "1. What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?\n",
        "\n",
        "- Object-Oriented Programming or OOPs refers to languages that use objects in programming. Object-oriented programming aims to implement real-world entities like inheritance, hiding, polymorphism, etc in programming. The main aim of OOP is to bind together the data and the functions that operate on them so that no other part of the code can access this data except that function.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. What is a class in OOP?\n",
        "- A class is a user-defined data type. It consists of data members and member functions, which can be accessed and used by creating an instance of that class. It represents the set of properties or methods that are common to all objects of one type. A class is like a blueprint for an object.  \n",
        "\n",
        "3. what is an object in OOP?\n",
        "- It is a basic unit of Object-Oriented Programming and represents the real-life entities. An Object is an instance of a Class. When a class is defined, no memory is allocated but when it is instantiated (i.e. an object is created) memory is allocated. An object has an identity, state, and behavior. Each object contains data and code to manipulate the data. Objects can interact without having to know details of each other’s data or code, it is sufficient to know the type of message accepted and type of response returned by the objects.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. What is the difference between abstraction and encapsulation?\n",
        "- Data abstraction is one of the most essential and important features of object-oriented programming. Data abstraction refers to providing only essential information about the data to the outside world, hiding the background details or implementation.\n",
        "- Encapsulation is defined as the wrapping up of data under a single unit. It is the mechanism that binds together code and the data it manipulates.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. What are dunder methods in Python?\n",
        "- They are defined by built-in classes in Python and commonly used for operator overloading.\n",
        "6.  Explain the concept of inheritance in OOP?\n",
        "- Inheritance in object-oriented programming (OOP) is a fundamental concept that allows a class to inherit properties and behaviors from another class. This allows programmers to reuse code and create new classes based on existing ones\n",
        "\n",
        "7. What is polymorphism in OOP?\n",
        "- Polymorphism is one of the most important concepts in OOP. It describes the ability of something to have or to be displayed in more than one form. The different forms arise because these entities can be assigned different meanings and used in various ways in multiple contexts.\n",
        "\n",
        "8. How is encapsulation achieved in Python?\n",
        "- encapsulation is achieved primarily through a naming convention using single and double underscores to indicate \"protected\" and \"private\" members within a class, respectively, allowing developers to control access to data and methods by signaling which parts of a class should be considered internal and not directly accessed from outside the class; unlike some other languages, Python does not strictly enforce access restrictions, relying on this convention instead.\n",
        "\n",
        "9.what is constructor in python?\n",
        "- a constructor is a special method that is called automatically when an object is created from a class. Its main role is to initialize the object by setting up its attributes or state.\n",
        "\n",
        "The method __new__ is the constructor that creates a new instance of the class while __init__ is the initializer that sets up the instance attributes after creation. These methods work together to manage object creation and initialization.\n",
        "\n",
        "10.What are class and static methods in Python?\n",
        "- classmethod decorator is a built-in function decorator that is an expression that gets evaluated after your function is defined. The result of that evaluation shadows your function definition. A class method receives the class as an implicit first argument, just like an instance method receives the instance\n",
        "- A static method does not receive an implicit first argument. A static method is also a method that is bound to the class and not the object of the class. This method can’t access or modify the class state. It is present in a class because it makes sense for the method to be present in class.\n",

        "- decorator feature in Python wraps in a function, appends several functionalities to existing code and then returns it. Methods and functions are known to be callable as they can be called. Therefore, a decorator is also a callable that returns callable. This is also known as metaprogramming as at compile time a section of program alters another section of the program.\n",

        "- We can build the programs from standard working modules that communicate with one another, rather than having to start writing the code from scratch which leads to saving of development time and higher productivity,\n",
        "- OOP language allows to break the program into the bit-sized problems that can be solved easily (one object at a time).\n",

        "- OOP systems can be easily upgraded from small to large systems.\n",

        "17. What is the difference between a class variable and an instance variable?\n",
        "- Instance Variable: It is basically a class variable without a static modifier and is usually shared by all class instances. Across different objects, these variables can have different values. They are tied to a particular object instance of the class, therefore, the contents of an instance variable are totally independent of one object instance to others.\n",
        "- Class Variable: It is basically a static variable that can be declared anywhere at class level with static. Across different objects, these variables can have only one value. These variables are not tied to any particular object of the class, therefore, can share across all objects of the class.  \n",

        "- Inheritance is the mechanism to achieve the re-usability of code as one class(child class) can derive the properties of another class(parent class). It also provides transitivity ie. if class C inherits from P then all the sub-classes of C would also inherit from P.\n",

        "- In Python, the str() and repr() functions are used to obtain string representations of objects. While they may seem similar at first glance, there are some differences in how they behave. Both of the functions can be helpful in debugging or printing useful information about the object.\n",

        "20. What is the significance of the ‘super()’ function in Python?\n",
        "- the super() function is used to refer to the parent class or superclass. It allows you to call methods defined in the superclass from the subclass, enabling you to extend and customize the functionality inherited from the parent class.\n",

        "- The __del__ method is a special method in Python that is called when an object is about to be destroyed. It allows you to define specific cleanup actions that should be taken when an object is garbage collected. This method can be particularly useful for releasing external resources such as file handles, network connections, or database connections that the object may hold.\n",
